# SocialNorm

# Inspiration
I wanted a social media web app that was responsive enough so that I could use it on my desktop and phone,
without downloading anything. I also wanted a way to remain completely anonymous when posting content (comments remain public),
while still being able to privately message other users.

# What it does
On SocialNorm, you can chose from a variety of topics to post content under.
When a user posts content, they remain completely anonymous, so you have no worry of being judged or
ridiculed for what you post, and only you can see what you post. You can search for other content, engage
in the comment section of posts with other users (it is public who posts comments), as well as direct message
other users.

# How I Did It
I worked on the entire front-end and back-end of the web app. I used the Spring MVC framework in the Eclipse
Photon IDE using Java as back-end and HTML/CSS/JavaScript as front-end. I incorporated Bootstrap and jQuery
libraries, as well as a variety of other dependencies using Maven. I hosted the app of Heroku and used a JawsDB/MySQL
database. The app itself is completely responsive and can be easily viewed on mobile, tablet, or desktop. Check it out!
